### Continuous Autoregressive Language Models
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27688v1
摘要: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

### PETAR: Localized Findings Generation with Mask-Aware Vision-Language
  Modeling for PET Automated Reporting
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27680v1
摘要: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

### Dark-Field X-Ray Imaging Significantly Improves Deep-Learning based
  Detection of Synthetic Early-Stage Lung Tumors in Preclinical Models

摘要: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer
screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack
LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer
detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening
Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of
26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)
radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar
microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly
improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning
segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of
euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular
boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A
U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,
or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels.Results show that the DFI-only model
achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51
percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus
92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent
sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially
improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation
radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose
alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is
unavailable.

### On Selecting Few-Shot Examples for LLM-based Code Vulnerability
  Detection
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27675v1
摘要: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for
many coding tasks, including summarization, translation, completion, and code
generation. However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task
for LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning
(ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct
answers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However,
choosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model
performance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot
examples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first
criterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a
sample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about
its usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity
of the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples
based on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations
to determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under
various combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.

### Culture Cartography: Mapping the Landscape of Cultural Knowledge
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27672v1
摘要: To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific
knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such
knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The
most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define
challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or
users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge
extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,
where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs
steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's
goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.
Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has
low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps
therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model
towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a
tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer
LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces
knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even
with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B
by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

### MolChord: Structure-Sequence Alignment for Protein-Guided Drug Design
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27671v1
摘要: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.

### Bayesian model selection and misspecification testing in imaging inverse
  problems only from noisy and partial measurements
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27663v1
摘要: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to
address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper
addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground
truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification
diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable
for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and
incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine
learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model
selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on
a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized
measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian
imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate
the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types
of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection
accuracy with a low computational cost.

### Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  in Open Agent Systems
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659v1
摘要: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

### Community Detection on Model Explanation Graphs for Explainable AI
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27655v1
摘要: Feature-attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) explain individual predictions
but often miss higher-order structure: sets of features that act in concert. We
propose Modules of Influence (MoI), a framework that (i) constructs a model
explanation graph from per-instance attributions, (ii) applies community
detection to find feature modules that jointly affect predictions, and (iii)
quantifies how these modules relate to bias, redundancy, and causality
patterns. Across synthetic and real datasets, MoI uncovers correlated feature
groups, improves model debugging via module-level ablations, and localizes bias
exposure to specific modules. We release stability and synergy metrics, a
reference implementation, and evaluation protocols to benchmark module
discovery in XAI.

### Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign
  Recognition
链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651v1
摘要: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.
