Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an enabling technology across multiple industries. 
In healthcare, AI assists in disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized treatment. 
In finance, it is used for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk modeling. 
In transportation, AI powers autonomous vehicles, route optimization, and predictive maintenance. 
In manufacturing, AI improves quality inspection and process automation.

人工智能技术在现实中已无处不在：  
医疗领域使用深度学习进行影像识别与辅助诊断；  
金融领域利用模型评估风险与防止欺诈；  
交通与工业领域用强化学习优化调度与能耗。  
随着算力提升与数据积累，AI 的趋势正从单一任务模型转向多模态、通用智能系统。
